## Reproducibility Crisis

**More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments,** and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments. \
\
\
The data reveal sometimes-*contradictory* attitudes towards reproducibility. Although 52% of those surveyed agree that there is a significant 'crisis' of reproducibility, less than 31% think that failure published results means that the result is probably wrong, and most say that they still trust the published literature.

# The Survey
\
In the survey [^1] respondents were asked to rate 11 different approaches to improving reproducibility in science . Below is the list order by the most highly rated:

+ Better understanding of statistics
+ Better mentoring/supervision
+ More robust design
+ Better teaching
+ More within-lab validation
+ Incentives for better practice
+ Incentives for formal reproduction
+ More external-lab validation
+ More time for mentoring
+ Journals enforcing standards
+ More time checking notebooks
